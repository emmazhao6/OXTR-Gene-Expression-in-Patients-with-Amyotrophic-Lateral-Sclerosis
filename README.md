# OXTR-Gene-Expression-in-Patients-with-Amyotrophic-Lateral-Sclerosis
What visualizations did you use to look at your data in different ways? 
I am going to check the new gene, OXTR, to look at the association between OXTR and ALS risk by comparing the gene expression level in ALS patients and healthy control group.
What are the different statistical methods you considered? I am going to use R, Linux, python which did not mention in the study.
Why did you select the packages you did? The OXTR is a pain risk gene which related to etiology of neuropathy. By assessing and comparation of the gene expression level between ALS and healthy control group, we can understand the potential pathological mechanisms of ALS.
