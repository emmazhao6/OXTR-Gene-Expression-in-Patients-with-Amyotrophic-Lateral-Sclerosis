# OXTR-Gene-Expression-in-Patients-with-Amyotrophic-Lateral-Sclerosis
Research goal: To compare OXTR gene expression level to elucidate genetic differences between the ALS and neurologically healthy control groups that may contribute to disease pathology.
Initial questions: What is the association between OXTR gene expression and ALS incidence?
