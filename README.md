# OXTR-Gene-Expression-in-Patients-with-Amyotrophic-Lateral-Sclerosis
Background of the research: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a non-demyelinating neurodegenerative disease in adults characterized by progressive muscle paralysis. Muscle paralysis is determined by the degeneration of motoneurons in the motor cortex brainstem and spinal cord. The ALS pathogenetic mechanisms are still unclear. The OXTR, a 7-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor capable of binding to either Gi or Gq proteins, activates a set of signaling cascades, such as the MAPK, PKC, PLC, or CaMK pathways. The cellular response to OXT include of neurite outgrowth, cellular viability, and increased survival.RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology is a high-throughput sequencing technology which has developed rapidly in recent years. It can study gene function, gene structure and gene expression changes at the level of gene transcription and explore the genetic evidence supporting ALS treatment of peripheral nerve injury.
